# Exploration of Different Deep Learning Frameworks

### Why this project
1. summarize usage patterns of deep learning for different tasks such as images, texts, speech, image-text embedding and etc.
2. write tutorial code on how to use them

### What we want to cover
1. how to use a specific framework
2. how to pick the model for different data
3. how to integrate deeplearning models created by specific framework with other machine leanring pipes
4. some insights on how to build deep learning models
5. interesting use cases
