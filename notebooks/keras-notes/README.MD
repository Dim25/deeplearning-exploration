# Notes for Keras Deep Learning Library
## Create a separate folder for Keras as it has gained a lot of my interests recently, for
- It unifies Theano and Tensorflow
- It supports both higher level API and lower level (e.g., via functional API)
- It is well documented - good organization of packages, and reading the API itself is educational
- Its focus on involving state-of-art DL techniques, reusing existing results and preprocessing of common data (e.g., images and texts)
- A lot of more
## The focus of these notes will be on high-level summary of how Keras is used in this fast-growing area
- Things will change because the library itself is changing very fast.
