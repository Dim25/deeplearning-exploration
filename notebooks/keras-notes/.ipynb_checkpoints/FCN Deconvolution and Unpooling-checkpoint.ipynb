    "# To figure out how Deconvolution and Unpooling work\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Resources\n",
    "- It seems that Deconvolution & Unpooling has been mentioned staring from this [paper](http://www.matthewzeiler.com/pubs/cvpr2010/cvpr2010.pdf) and this [paper](http://www.matthewzeiler.com/pubs/iccv2011/iccv2011.pdf), in a context of being used as a convolutioal sparse encoding to learn filters and feature maps. The idea is similiar to encoding of an autoencoder. This [thread](https://www.quora.com/How-does-a-deconvolutional-neural-network-work) has a good discussion.\n",
    "- Then it has been discussed as a way of mapping back feature maps to origina image spaces in these papers: [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2901), [2](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf), [3](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04366) and [4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf).\n",
    "- Two useful resources on the mathematical definitions of these operations are \n",
    "    - [torch documentation](https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/doc/convolution.md#spatialmaxunpooling)\n",
    "    - [PRMLSS slides](http://aisociety.kr/prml/PRMLSS_2015_deconvolution.pdf)\n",
    "    - [stackoverflow page](http://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/6107/8820)\n",
    "- Implementations in different libraries\n",
    "    - [theano deconvolution](https://github.com/Theano/Theano/pull/3872)\n",
    "    - [tensorflow deconvolution](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/256)\n",
    "    - [tensorflow unpooling](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/2169)\n",
    "    - [caffe unpooling](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/pull/2561)\n",
    "    - keras: has deconvolution implementation which is consistent with tf and th. But not an unpooling that uses a switch variable."
