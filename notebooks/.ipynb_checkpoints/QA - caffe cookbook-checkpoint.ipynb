Layers can be imagined as \"nodes\"\" in a DAG graph, and the connections between nodes are the \"flow of data\", which are defined as **Blobs** in Caffe. Each layer in the model has a \"type\", and optionally its connected \"input\" and \"output\", and \"weights\" parameters. \n",
    "The static model is defined as *** model prototype (.prototxt)*** file (the txt version of google protobuf). Since the structure and flow (nodes and connections) of the model depends on how it is used (e.g., training, evaluation), there might be multiple model prototype files, e.g., \"train_val.prototxt\" and \"deploy.prototxt\".\n",
    "- ***Dynamically***, there are two computation flows through the model - `forward` and `backward`. Both can happen through the whole network or only across several layers. Most of time, the backward computation requires the model to cache the forward results, which is expensive for a forward-only case. So the caffe model usually needs to explicitly specify the ***force_backward*** parameter to be true in model prototype - equivallent to making the DAG graph of net *bidirectional*.\n",

    "- The `solver_type` parameter specifies the training algorithm. It has three choices, namely Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Gradient (ADAGRAD), and Nesterov’s Accelerated Gradient (NESTEROV). In practice it is uncommon, but used in [mnist example](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/examples/mnist/mnist_autoencoder_solver_adagrad.prototxt)\n",
    "- the `SGD` solver updates weight by a linear combination of negative gradient (weighted by  learning rate $\\alpha$) and previous weight date (weighted by momentum $\\mu$): $$V_{t+1} = \\mu V_t - \\alpha \\nabla L(W_t)$$ $$W_{t+1} = W_t + V_{t+1}$$\n",
    "    - The best practice for SGD is to initialize the learning rate $\\alpha$ to a value around 0.01, and decreasing it by a constant factor, e.g., 10 throughout training when the loss begins to reach an apprarent \"plateau\", repeating this several times. \n",
    "    - The momentum $\\mu$ tends to make sgd both stable and fast, and a general choice is $\\mu = 0.9$\n",
    "    - if learning diverge (e.g. initial loss values are very big or even init), try reduce base_lr to e.g. 0.001\n",
    "    - the parameter `lr_policy` controls how learning rate changes with iterations. See [stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30033096/what-is-lr-policy-in-caffe) for details. Basically, \"fixed\" assumes a fixed learning rate, \"inv\" assumes learning rate is proportional to $1/iters$, `step` use a factor of `gamma` every fixed iters and it results in a piecewise constant learning rate, `multiplestep` assumes arbitrary intervals.\n",
    "- the `AdaGrad` solver: the idea of adaptive gradient method is to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. In practice, it uses a \"normalized\" version of gradient, over a certain period, which plays a similiar role to momentum.  $$(W_{t+1})_i = (W_t)_i - \\alpha \\frac{(\\nabla L(W_t))_i}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{t'=1}^{t} (\\nabla L(W_{t'}))_i^2}}$$ \n",
    "- the `NAG` solver: the Nesterov's accelerated gradient achives a better convergence rate for convex optimization problems. Even though most optimizations involved in deep learning is not convex, in practice the method can still achive better performance in convergence. \n",
